Final Project - Club Attendance manager

Nicholas Heineman, Will Ryan, Nikesh Walling

One of our previous team members created a project that allowed a specific club to record attendance for its members. We are hoping to work with this framework, and turning it into a generic website that could be set up and used by any club, as well as implement further functionality use by both the club managers and the members.
